👋 Hi, I’m qzhl

I’m a Back-End Engineer with 4+ years of experience, currently majoring in Information Technology & Business Management at SouthTech Academy. I’m also the CEO and Studio Owner of Darkk Games game development studio, where I lead technical direction, system architecture, and long-term product strategy.

My work focuses on building scalable, maintainable back-end systems that support complex gameplay mechanics, data-driven features, and long-term live service development. I have extensive experience designing modular architectures, optimizing server performance, and structuring clean, readable codebases that scale with growing teams and player bases.

As both an engineer and a studio owner, I bridge the gap between technical execution and business strategy — ensuring projects are not only well-built, but also sustainable, efficient, and production-ready.

If you’re interested in collaboration, backend architecture, or game development — feel free to explore my repositories or reach out.
